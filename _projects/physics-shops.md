      <h2><span class="numerals {{ page.type }}">00</span> Background</h2>
      <p>The Department of Physics is home to a number of in-house shops which provide services to their faculty members and graduate students for a nominal fee. Charges are collected by the shops, then billed on a quarterly basis back to client&mdash;principal investigator (PI)&mdash;accounts. Physics approached us to help them with a cost-effective way to streamline this process.</p>
      <h2><span class="numerals {{ page.type }}">01</span> Discovery</h2>
      <p>In reviewing the shop billing and chargeback process from start to finish with the administrators and one of the shop supervisors, we found that there were a number of paper documents used for tracking hours and materials. Because the process for tracking and billing for services was not consistent for all shops, manually transcribing and compiling these documents into usable reports was very labour intensive.</p>

      <h2><span class="numerals {{ page.type }}">02</span> Ideation + Development</h2>
      <p>Administrators and shop staff were already using spreadsheets in some capacity for tracking and reporting. After weighing the pros and cons of a new development project, we decided to implement a lightweight solution using familiar and free tools&mdash;the Google Suite.</p>
      <h3>Project, time and materials tracking</h3>
      <p>We were able to leverage Google Forms, Sheets, Calendar, and Scripts to create an easy-to-use online system for technicians to track their time and materials.</p>

      <h3>Reporting and chargeback</h3>
      <p>Having everything stored in Google Drive allowed department administrators to run automated reports on current data whenever necessary.</p>
