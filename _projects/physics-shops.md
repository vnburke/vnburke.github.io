      <h2><span class="numerals {{ page.type }}">00</span> Background</h2>
      <p>The Department of Physics is home to a number of in-house shops which provide services to their faculty members and graduate students for a nominal fee. Charges are collected by the shops, then billed to quarterly back to the principal investigator's (PI) account.</p>
      <p>However, the process for tracking and billing for these services were not consistent across the shops and much of the tracking was recorded manually on paper then transcribed to a spreadsheet at a later date. Physics approached us to help them with a cost-effective way to streamline this process.</p>

      <h2><span class="numerals {{ page.type }}">02</span> Ideation + Development</h2>
      <p>After weighing a number of options, we decided that we could implement a solution using familiar and free tools&mdash;the Google Suite. We were able to leverage Google Forms, Sheets and Scripts to create an easy-to-use online system for tracking time and materials for the technicians, which then allowed department administrators to run automated reports on the data whenever necessary.</p>
