      <h2><span class="numerals {{ page.type }}">00</span> Background</h2>
      <p>Hosted by the Department of Computing Science at the University of Alberta, <em>Reverse Expo</em> brings academia and industry together to promote collaboration. Unlike typical recruitment events where companies give their pitch to students, <em>Reverse Expo</em> allows students to take the lead.</p>
      <h2><span class="numerals {{ page.type }}">01</span> Discovery</h2>
      <p>Championed by a few faculty members in conjunction with the Computing Science Graduate Student Association, the event addressed a gap in networking events for graduate students. In its inaugural year (2018), the event organizers knew that a clear and professional visual identity for the Reverse Expo would help establish it as a staple in years to come.</p>
      <p>As part of our discovery, I led the organizing committee in a brainstorming session to identify all of the potential benefits of the event. We then prioritized these benefits and found the focus to be on <strong>connecting graduate students with internships or job opportunities</strong>.</p>
      <h2><span class="numerals {{ page.type }}">02</span> Ideation + Design</h2>
      <p>The branding explores the conference's role reversal, and the interconnectedness and overlap between research and industry. I chose reliable and professional corporate blues infused with a touch of red research energy. A monotype-esque sans-serif reminicient of the console reminds us that this is a computing science event.</p>

      <p>To help students engage guests from industry and government and explore potential partnerships, we gave each student a small run of customized business cards for the event where they could list their area of research and contact information. We also added flags to both the business cards and student name badges to make it clear to our guests which students were seeking internship or employment opportunities.</p>
      <h2><span class="numerals {{ page.type }}">03</span> Solution</h2>
      <p>The final branding was used in printed and digital signage, name badges for all attendees, and student business cards. Happy to report that the first <em>Reverse Expo</em> was a success and continues to grow each year!</p>
