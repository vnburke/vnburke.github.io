      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Once upon a time at the University of Alberta, every instructor who wanted to have a class website had to come up with a solution on their own and students had to keep track of all the different course urls. Some faculties or departments supported their own systems, but there was nothing used campus-wide. In 2011, the Vice-President (Information Technology) decided to transition the institution to a centrally managed learning management system called <em>eClass</em>, powered by the open-source system, Moodle.</p>
      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p><em>eClass</em> provided instructors with a customizable platform to host their class sites that included built in tools such as calendars, notices, discussion forums and quizzes. It also provided students with a more integrated experience&mdash;each having a personal portal with their course sites upon login. The responsive theme was developed to align with the U of A style guide.</p>
      <h2>Highlights</h2>
      <p>The Learning Management Transition Team was recognized with the <strong>IT Project Award (2013)</strong> for this project.</p>
