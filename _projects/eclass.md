      <h2><span class="numerals {{ page.type }}">00</span> Background</h2>
      <p>When Blackboard announced it would be terminating its support for Vista, the University of Alberta had a decision to make about its learning management system (LMS). In 2010, the Vice-President (Information Technology) created an arm's length committee to research and consult with the University community on the choice of the next <abbr title="Learning management system">LMS</abbr>. The committee decided that the institution should use the open-source system, Moodle, to power <em>eClass</em>&mdash;the centrally managed learning management system.</p>
      <h2><span class="numerals {{ page.type }}">01</span> Discovery</h2>
      <p>Although the central system supported many courses, instructors and students, there were still a fair number of faculties or departments <strong>supporting their own learning management systems</strong> because <strong>the central solution was not meeting their needs</strong>.</p>
      <p>Change management was going to be key for the success of the transition. Part of my role on this project included devising and executing a communications plan to make sure instructors and students alike were aware of the changes that were coming and the timelines associated with the transition.</p>

            <td>The communications strategy had to use many different approaches in order to reach all of the students and instructors. It included posters and digital signage, a roadshow at key locations around campus, and communication with our champions in each faculty. To keep everyone informed about the changes, timelines, and next steps, we created an eClass transition site to act as the hub.</td>

Working with the knowledgable staff at the Centre for Teaching and Learning (CTL) and a pre-established group of engaged instructors representing faculties and departments across campus, we logged the frustrations with current systems and prioritized features that could be integrated into <em>eClass</em>.</td>
