      <!-- <h2>Meet Vanessa</h2> -->
      <p class="lead sm"><span class="lead med">Hi, I'm <strong>Vanessa</strong></span>&mdash;a designer, problem solver and user-experience enthusiast with 15+ years of experience based in Edmonton, Canada. I'm a hometown gal&mdash;and as such, am excited by <strong>challenging problems</strong> and opportunities to <strong>grow and build our communities</strong>.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>Fuelled by <strong>coffee</strong> and <strong>curiosity</strong></h2>
      <p>I earned my Bachelor of Design in Visual Communication (with a specialization in Computing Science) from the University of Alberta. Although I didn't pursue graduate studies, I am constantly in pursuit of knowledge and have taken courses of all kinds over the years&mdash;from photography to <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> to <a href="https://www.edmonton.ca/programs_services/landscaping_gardening/compost-education.aspx">Edmonton's Compost S'cool</a>. My current interests include a mix of data visualization, sustainability and diversity.</p>

      <!-- <h2>Challenge <strong>accepted</strong>!</h2>
      <p>As fate would have it, I have spent most of my career in the digital space&mdash;a field that is ever evolving. Though digging into user research or analyzing data may not be very glamourous, gleaning insight to inform design that solves problems for people makes it all worthwhile!</p> -->

      <h2>The <strong>little</strong> things</h2>
      <p>When I'm not working, you can find me on the <a href="https://eupa.ca/">ultimate frisbee field</a> (virtually, atm), baking things with lots of butter, puttering around in the garden or wrangling kiddos.</p>
